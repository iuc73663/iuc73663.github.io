          <h2>Automated installer(s)</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Some of the larger projects that I have worked on included the automation of installation wizards/tasks to ease the time spent
            These installation wizards taught me a lot about how Windows manages systems, and clever tricks to get certain tasks to kick off.
            The installers primarily used also required further tasks to execute, such as the creation/dropping of SQL schemas, the pushing of certain files to certain directories, as well as file manipulation.
            Here is a short list of functions that I learned while working on these scripts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Launching the uninstall wizard through the registry by filtering keys.</li>
            <li>Selecting entire tables using sql scripts and organizing data as usable scripts.</li>
            <li>Moving files throughout different directories to accomplish tasks.</li>
            <li>Creating Checks and Balances for sequential tasks to ensure that everything was running properly.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Backup Utilities</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            A large portion of my work required manually inputing fields based on data sets. To save time, I created tools
            that would help my team to recover data.
            These tools enabled my team to switch from manually writing/recording each data set, to simply running my executable to take backups.
            By learning the ins and outs of the application we supported, I found a use for a hidden 'RAW' data set, which I used to create BackUps from a server.
            These tools were portable, time efficient, and very easy to use.

          <h2>Various scripts</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Using AutoIt allowed for quick develpment for internal tools. Mainly scripts required to manipulate data, and merge files that were then run on
            WIndows Servers through the Task Scheduler.
            I also created a tool to compare datasets for a department that looks at Nutritional information. They were manually comparing columns of information,
            and by providing them with a tool that generated a report, I was able to save them hours of repeptitive labor.
